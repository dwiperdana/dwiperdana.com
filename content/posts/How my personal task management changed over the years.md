Over the years, I tried a lot of tools and system to keep myself to be productive. Some works, some don't. Here are several notable tools and system I remember, and my current task management setup.

## System
### 🤷‍♂️ No system
This is where I started, knowing nothing about task management or schedules/timetable. A lot of things I forgot to bring to school, homework done before the class starts, and of course quizes that I didn't prepare the night before. FYI, I made my first timetable in my first year of college 🙃 I don't know how I survived until high school.
### ☑ To do lists
Ah, the almighty to do lists. It was simple enough, write down the things you want to do, and it will be done. Right?

Unfortunately no. Writing your to do is only the first step to actually doing and finishing them. Several important things:
- If the task is complex (require several steps or need some kind of resources I don't currently have) I tend to postpone them... Without doing anything to actually finish that task
- If the task don't have a due date, or a scheduled date, I usually forgot to finish it. Even if they have a due date, if it was already overdue, more likely I will forget them. (nowadays, I always change the date around, esp. for important tasks)
- If I put my to do all over the place (without a way to actually retrieve them), I will forget them. This happens when I use paper notebook, tasks on Evernote/Notion pages (this is why you should use the database feature on Notion).
- If my to do list is too long, I always feel overwhelmed and confused on what to do next (some people call this [[paralysis by analysis]]).
