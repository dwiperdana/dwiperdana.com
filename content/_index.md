Hello! Welcome to my corner on the internet. This is the where I put my latest writings and notes. You can find notes about game development, personal improvement, and other stuff that interest me. If you somehow want to contact me, 

Rough idea on what to put in this site:
- Company review from game industry
	- e.g. [[companies/Keyword Studios]]
- Content summary (podcast, video, course?)
- Learning curriculum and notes
	- General competence
