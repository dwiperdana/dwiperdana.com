Over the years, I tried a lot of tools and system to keep myself to be productive. Some works, some don't. Here are several notable tools and system I remember, and my current task management setup.

## System
### 🤷‍♂️ No system
This is where I started, knowing nothing about task management or schedules/timetable. A lot of things I forgot to bring to school, homework done before the class starts, and of course quizes that I didn't prepare the night before. FYI, I made my first ever timetable in my first year of college 🙃 I don't know how I survived until high school.
### ☑ To do lists
Ah, the almighty to do lists. It was simple enough, write down the things you want to do, and it will be done. Right?

Unfortunately no. Writing your to do is only the first step to actually doing and finishing them. Several important things:
- If the task is complex (require several steps or need some kind of resources I don't currently have) I tend to postpone them... Without doing anything to actually finish that task...
- If the task don't have a due date, or a scheduled date, I usually forgot to finish it. Even if they have a due date, if it was already overdue, more likely I will forget them. (nowadays, I always change the date around, esp. for important tasks)
- If I put my to do all over the place (without a way to actually retrieve them), I will forget them. This happens when I use paper notebook, tasks on Evernote/Notion pages (this is why you should use the database feature on Notion).
- If my to do list is too long, I always feel overwhelmed and confused on what to do next (some people call this [[paralysis by analysis]]).
### 📥 [[notes/GTD]] (Getting Things Done) by [[David Allen]]
Getting Things Done is actually one of the first task management system I learned, they have some concepts that I used daily since:
#### **Inbox** (Capturing): 
> Put everything new in one place, that will be your inbox.

Don't try to remember everything, but [[write everything down]]. The additional benefit of writing everything down, is that things or tasks won't occupy my mind, but I'm confident that I can remember things by looking in my notes. Before heavily taking notes, I always get the feeling "I feel like I'm forgetting something..."

Anothey key point in the [[Inbox]] method is that not every new task will need your immediate attention. **Just focus on putting it in the inbox**. These includes:
- Ideas you get from reading an article or watching a video.
- Important document shared in a meeting or discussion that you need to review.
- Facts or information that you think will be useful in the future.
#### **Prioritization** (Processing): 
> Go through your inbox, and put every task on their place.

If you do the first step correctly, you can be confident that you won't miss a thing. Now you need to sort it all out, because every task is not equal. Some is simple, some is complex, some actionable, some dont, etc. iirc, GTD ask you to sort every task using to criteria, [[importance]] and [[urgency]]. Every combination will have different treatment (sorted by priority):
- **Important Not Urgent**: These are your key strategies, your long term projects, your moon shots. You should always ==prioritize them==, because otherwise, you will stuck in a loop of constant urgent tasks that keeping you in the same place. Remember to set aside time to do important tasks daily.
- **Urgent Important**: These are the tasks that always comes up in your day by day, but can't be postponed. Firefighting, they said. Like it or not, you need to ==finish them==. But make sure they don't consume the time for your important tasks.
- **Urgent Not Important**: These are small tasks that wants your attention and usually took a lot of time. You should ==delegate them== to your team member. If you don't have any team member you can delegate to, make sure you put efforts to simplify the task by creating [[templates]], do them in [[batch]], or better, make some kind of [[automation]].
- **Not Urgent Not Important**: These tasks should not have your attention, why do things that are not important nor urgent. Usually these tasks are things that are 'nice to have' or just an 'idea' from other people. ==Delete them==.

#### **Next action** (Doing): 
> Pick the most important task as your next item. Don't do other task before the next item is done.

Ideally, at any point in time, you only have exactly one item in your to do list, as this is the definition of [[Priority]].
> pri·or·i·ty /prīˈôrədē/: the fact or condition of being regarded or treated as more important.

We don't live in an ideal world, so we usually have 3-5 things on our to do list. Usually because not everything we can finish alone, e.g. need approval from other, need information from others, etc. But rest assured, if you do the previous steps correctly, you should always working on the most important thing to **get things done**.
### [[notes/PARA]]
> Tasks without context won't help you achieve big things, so every task should serve their purpose: as part of a project, or part of a responsibility.

[PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) is a system created by [[Tiago Forte]].
- Projects
- Area
- Resouces
- Archive

Some good notes I took:
- Everything should be in a project or responsibility
- Every project should be supporting a goal
- You should have a consistent foldering/naming system across all your tools
### [[notes/Zettelkasten]]
> Create a lot of notes, atomic notes. Their name and location is not important, the connections between them is.

This is not actually task management system, but a personal knowledge management system. [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) teach me about creating connection between things, and getting insights by actually connecting the dots. I first comes across this method from [[Ryan Holiday]].
### [[PPV]] 
> Be deliberate about your goals and how to achieve them.
> Create system or habits, not goals. ~ [[James Clear]], [[Atomic Habits]]

PPV or [Pillars, Pipelines, and Vaults](https://www.yearzero.io/notion-life-design), is a system created by [[August Bradley]]. I didn't get his courses, only learning from his youtube videos regarding PPV.

Adding routines/habits and evaluation process to make sure I can always be better than yesterday.
## Tools
### 🧠 Your Brain
You will forget stuff
### 📓 Paper Notebook
you can't search on your book
### 📧 Email
- using folder/tags on gmail
- not relevant anymore because most of work/communication using chat now (Teams, Slack)
- pros:
	- Each discussion is on their own thread
	- business formal communication still using email
- cons:
	- quoted emails are hard to read and to maintain
	- people usually missed reading or replying their emails
### 📆 Calendar
- using tasks on calendar (part of google calendar feature)
- benefit: you can clearly know when things happened, and can help with evaluation or reflection
### ☁ Digital Notebook on the cloud (Evernote, OneNote, Notion)
- cons: Slower, vendor lock
### 💾 Digital Notebook on local file (Notepad, Emacs, Obsidian)
- Future proof
## My Current Setup (end of 2022)

### Obsidian
- Everything is a note
- Highly customizable: Dataview, Tasks, Supercharged Links
### Tasks
- Every task is just a line of text, other properties is optional and also text based
### Daily Notes
- My version of Inbox, where I put everything on a particular day
- I can see tasks that are need to be done that day
- I can go to any date and see the notes I made that day and every tasks scheduled but not done yet
### People Tags
- I took note of everyone that related to a task, e.g. the person need something from me, or the person that will be doing the task for me
- I can filter tasks that are related with someone
### Projects
- Every project should have at least one next action item
- Every project have their own PIC
### Folders
This is my latest improvement to my task management system in 2022.
> I put all my notes, files, and bookmarks in one place: OneDrive

- Each important project will have their own folder, with relevant files (and bookmarks) in one place
- Several folders is actuall a 'database' of notes with similar type
