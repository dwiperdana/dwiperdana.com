This book is a journal of the transformation of the USS Santa Fe from an sub-par into an exceptional team. The author, captain himself, describe his thought process of very major change he did to transform his team members. This book gives a lot of insight for leaders to build their members into potential future leaders. The best thing is, because it was based on true events, we got a clear and practical picture of the implementation of those insights within USS Santa Fe.

I read this book in a transitional phase in my organization, so it gives me some valuable insights: 
1) Communication is the key, everyone in our organization needs to know the organizations goal and strive their own personal development goals. 
2) Use deliberate action (e.g. using ‘I intend to’ or similar phrases) to build problem solving skills and minimize mistakes because every leader can give immediate feedback for every action. 
3) Leaders should be in the front line, connecting with the team to build the culture of empowerment and implement any change needed. 
4) Make sure every leader in our team understand their responsibility and collaborate with others to achieve the organization’s goal, not bound by hierarchies or bureaucracies.

One thing that should be noted that the motivation of the team would be different between a military organization like the navy with a business company. We need to make sure all the team members have the motivation to improve to be better and to be a leader in the future.
